# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mouloud

I'm a PhD specializing in **Artificial Intelligence** â€” with a strong focus on building intelligent systems that scale.

ðŸ’» I work across:
- **Backend development** with **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **Node.js**
- **Frontend & Mobile** using **React (Next.js)** and **React Native (Expo)**
- **AI/ML** with tools like **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **scikit-learn**, and **Hugging Face**

ðŸš€ I enjoy transforming cutting-edge research into real-world products â€” from prototypes to production.

ðŸ“š Always exploring what's next in AI, system design, and developer tooling.

ðŸ§  Open to collaborations that advance whatâ€™s possible with AI.
